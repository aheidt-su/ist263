Allen Heidt
I am a finance and information technology major, interested in tracking financial markets using advanced technology solutions. I have professional experience in financial analysis as well as data models & database management. I am an eagle scout, member of the national honor society, and 5x dean’s list recipient.
Outside of work, I am a avid martial arts fan, I am a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, as well as the President of the Syracuse Wrestling Club. I have lived in over 6 countries, due to my father’s job as a member of the United States Foreign Service. I am also a dual citizen of the United States and Cambodia.
